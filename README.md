<h1>Dining philosophes</h1>

This is a repo with a solution for the dining philos algorithm. It works with threads synchronization using semaphores and mutex.
The program have 2 solutions :
  - One synchronous, which works using an ordonnancer scanning the philos from a didicated thread.
  - An other one asynchronous which uses an ordonnancer called only when needed.

Inside the projet there are many differents ordonnancers functions that i tried before ending up whith a fully functionnal one.
While thoses old version are not a right way to procceed, I left them in the script bc It may be intersting for understanding the final algorith
by looking at the reflexion path that i had.
